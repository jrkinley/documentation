- Links to internal wikis, PRDs, design docs, KIPs, training material, or slide decks.
- Links to engineering PRs that implement the update.
- Links to blog posts, if applicable.
- Identify specific Slack channels that the writer can join to get more details about the feature.
- Links to Slack conversations (RP and RP Community) about the issue.
- Names of SMEs who can answer questions and act as reviewers (at least one engineer and one PM).
- Any additional information that will be of use to the writer.

### If new feature, in which release is it included or expected?

### Additional notes

<!--
Documentation Issues must be distinct and not overlap. If filing an Issue for a feature that spans platform and cloud, you must file two separate Issues. Each Issue will drive the new content in GitHub for the respective platform or cloud doc. 

Include:
 - Relevant GitHub issues and pull requests
 - Dependencies on other features or components
 - Specific Redpanda contributors to notify
