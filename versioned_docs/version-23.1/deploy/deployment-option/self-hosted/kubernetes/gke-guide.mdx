Deploy a Redpanda cluster and Redpanda Console in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) using the Helm chart. Then, use rpk both as an internal client and an external client to interact with your Redpanda cluster from the command line.

<OperatorNote/>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you must have the following:

* Complete the 'Before you begin' steps and the 'Launch Cloud Shell' steps of the [GKE quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deploy-app-cluster#before-you-begin). Cloud Shell comes preinstalled with the Google Cloud CLI, the `kubectl` command-line tool, and the Helm package manager.

* [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/). Minimum required Kubernetes version: <Versions name="kubernetes"/>

  ```bash
  kubectl version
  ```

* [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/). Minimum required Helm version: <Versions name="helm"/>

  ```bash
  helm version
  ```

## Create a GKE cluster

Replace the `<region>` placeholder with your own region.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create redpanda \
  --machine-type n1-standard-4 \
  --num-nodes=3 \
  --region=<region>
```

## Configure external access to the Redpanda brokers

Because external clients are not in the Kubernetes cluster where the Redpanda brokers are running, they cannot resolve the internal addresses of the headless ClusterIP Service.
Instead, Redpanda brokers must also advertise an externally accessible adress that external clients can connect to.

The simplest option for development is to configure the Redpanda brokers to advertise the IP addresses of the worker nodes on which they are running, instead of the default `redpanda-<ordinal-number>.local` hostname.

:::note Only for development and testing
IP addresses can change. If the IP addresses of your LoadBalancer Services change, you must reconfigure the Redpanda brokers and all your external clients with the new IP addresses.
:::

:::tip
In production environments, it's best practice to use DNS. See [Configure External Access through a NodePort Service](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/networking/configure-external-access-nodeport).
:::

1. Add inbound firewall rules to your instances so that external traffic can reach each node port on all Kubernetes worker nodes in the cluster. See the [Google VPC documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/using-firewalls) for details.

1. Find the external IP addresses of all worker nodes in the cluster:

  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes -o wide
  ```

  <details>
  <summary>
  Example output
  </summary>

  ```text
  NAME                  EXTERNAL-IP
  example-worker        203.0.113.3
  example-worke2        203.0.113.5
  example-worker3       203.0.113.7
  ```

  </details>

  This example shows three worker nodes with the external IP addresses `203.0.113.3`, `203.0.113.5`, and `203.0.113.7`.

1. Find out on which worker node each Pod is running:

  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide -n redpanda
  ```

  <details>
  <summary>
  Example output
  </summary>

  ```text
  NAME                 NODE
  redpanda-0           example-worker
  redpanda-1           example-worker2
  redpanda-2           example-worker3
  ```

  </details>

  This example shows that the `redpanda-0` Pod is running on a worker node called `example-worker`. 
  
1. Use the node names to find the external IP address of the worker node that runs each Pod. For these examples, the result is the following:

  | Redpanda broker | External IP |
  |---|---|
  | redpanda-0 | 203.0.113.3 |
  | redpanda-1 | 203.0.113.5 |
  | redpanda-2 | 203.0.113.7 |

  :::note
  Make sure that the external IP address of the worker node matches the correct Redpanda broker. The worker nodes are not always displayed in the same order as the Pods.
  :::

1. Create a file called `my-values.yaml` and add the external IP addresses of your worker nodes to the `redpanda.external.addresses` field, making sure to match the order of the Pod names.

  ```yaml title="my-values.yaml"
  external:
    addresses: 
    - 203.0.113.3
    - 203.0.113.5
    - 203.0.113.7
  ```

  :::note
  The order of the IP addresses is important. Each IP address is assigned to a Redpanda broker to advertise, starting from `redpanda-0`. This is how clients learn how to address individual Redpanda brokers.
  :::

1. Apply these updates to the Helm deployment:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade redpanda redpanda/redpanda -n redpanda -f my-values.yaml
  ```

1. Install rpk on your local machine, not on a Pod:

  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ubuntu" label="Linux" default>

    <InstallRpkLinux/>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">

    <InstallRpkHomebrew/>

  </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

1. Set the `REDPANDA_BROKERS` environment variable to the external IP addresses of your worker nodes:

  ```bash
  export REDPANDA_BROKERS=203.0.113.3:31092,203.0.113.5:31092,203.0.113.7:31092
  ```

  :::note
  31092 is the Kafka API port that's exposed by the default NodePort Service.
  :::

1. Get the cluster info:

  ```bash
  rpk cluster info
  ```

  <details>
  <summary>
  Example output
  </summary>

  ```text
  CLUSTER
  =======
  redpanda.ad4a2f55-f34e-4a7f-babd-01d392cf4e80

  BROKERS
  =======
  ID    HOST           PORT
  0     203.0.113.3    31092
  1*    203.0.113.5    31092
  2     203.0.113.7    31092
  ```

  </details>

## Troubleshooting

### StatefulSet never rolls out

If the StatefulSet Pods remain in a pending state, they may be waiting for resources to become available:

* Make sure that you have a default StorageClass available in your Kubernetes cluster and that the underlying volumes have at least 20Gi of storage capacity.

  ```bash
  kubectl get storageclass
  ```

### dig not defined

`Error: parse error at (redpanda/templates/statefulset.yaml:203): function "dig" not defined`

If you see this error, make sure that you are using the correct version of Helm. See the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
