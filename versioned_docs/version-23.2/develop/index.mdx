- [Supported Kafka Clients](../develop/kafka-clients)

    Redpanda is compatible with Apache Kafka version 0.11 through 3.1. See exceptions to Kafka compatibilities. 

- [Use Redpanda with Kafka Client Libraries](../develop/code-examples)

    Follow an intermediate-level guide to create a topic, produce data, and consume data with different client libraries, including Go, Node.js, and Python.

- [Use Redpanda with NodeJS](../develop/guide-nodejs)

    See how to use Redpanda with kafkajs.

- [Use Redpanda with the HTTP Proxy API](../develop/http-proxy)

    Redpanda HTTP Proxy (`pandaproxy`) allows access to your data through a REST API. 

- [Produce Data](../develop/produce-data)

    Producers send data to brokers. Idempotent producers assign a unique ID to every write request.

- [Consume Data](../develop/consume-data/)
      
    Redpanda uses an internal topic, `__consumer_offsets`, to store committed offsets from each Kafka consumer that is attached to Redpanda. 

- [Transactions](../develop/transactions)

    Transactions guarantee both exactly-once semantics (EOS) and atomicity. For example, you can fetch messages starting from the last consumed offset and transactionally process them one by one, updating the last consumed offset and producing events at the same time.
