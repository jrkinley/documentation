Use `rpk` profiles to simplify working with Redpanda clusters by customizing, saving, and reusing configurations.

## About `rpk` profiles

An `rpk` profile contains a reusable configuration for a Redpanda cluster. When running `rpk`, you can create a profile, configure it for a cluster you're working with, then save it and reuse it later when working with the same cluster. 

You can create different profiles for different Redpanda clusters. For example, your local cluster, development cluster, and production cluster can each have their own profile, with all of their information stored in a single, local file. 

A profile saves the Redpanda node and cluster properties that rpk can already configure. For details, see [Specifying command properties](../intro-to-rpk#specifying-command-properties).

A profile also supports the customization of your command prompt. You can set your command prompt to display information about the profile that's in-use.

## Using `rpk` profiles

### Create profile

To create a new profile, run [`rpk profile create`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-profile/rpk-profile-create):

```bash
rpk profile create <profile-name>
```

Each profile must have a unique name.

To get a list of default settings, run `rpk -X help` and look for the keys that begin with `defaults`

### Update profile

To update a profile, you can either *set* or *edit* it:

- [`rpk profile set`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-profile/rpk-profile-set)

- [`rpk profile edit`](../../reference/rpk/rpk-profile/rpk-profile-set)

### Set profile

## Customize prompt

The `rpk profile prompt` command customizes your command prompt (specifically, its `PS1` prompt variable) to provide visible context about the profile that's in use.





## Print profile

Print rpk profile configuration.

If no name is specified, this command prints the current profile as it is
loaded in rpk with internal defaults, user specified flags, and environment
variables applied. If you wish to print the current raw profile as it exists
in rpk.yaml, you can use the --raw flag.

## Create profile

Create an rpk profile.

There are multiple ways to create a profile. If no name is provided, the
name "default" is used.

- You can use --from-redpanda to generate a new profile from an existing
  `redpanda.yaml` file. The special values "current" create a profile from the
  current `redpanda.yaml` as it is loaded within rpk.

- You can use --from-profile to generate a profile from an existing profile or
  from from a profile in a yaml file. First, the filename is checked, then an
  existing profile name is checked. The special value "current" creates a new
  profile from the existing profile.

- You can use --from-cloud to generate a profile from an existing cloud cluster
  id. Note that you must be logged in with 'rpk cloud login' first.

- You can use --set key=value to directly set fields. The key can either be
  the name of a -X flag or the path to the field in the profile's YAML format.
  For example, using --set tls.enabled=true OR --set kafka_api.tls.enabled=true
  is equivalent. The former corresponds to the -X flag tls.enabled, while the
  latter corresponds to the path kafka_api.tls.enabled in the profile's YAML.

The --set flag is always applied last and can be used to set additional fields
in tandem with --from-redpanda or --from-cloud.

The --set flag supports autocompletion, suggesting the -X key format. If you
begin writing a YAML path, the flag will suggest the rest of the path.

It is recommended to always use the --description flag; the description is
printed in the output of 'rpk profile list'.

rpk always switches to the newly created profile.
