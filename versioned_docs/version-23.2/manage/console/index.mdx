- [Kafka Connect](../console/kafka-connect)

    Redpanda Console provides a user interface to manage multiple Kafka connect clusters.

- [Schema Registry](../console/schema-registry)

    Configure Redpanda Console to deserialize Kafka records that were encoded by a Schema Registry compatible serializer.

- [Protobuf Deserialization](../console/protobuf)

    If you have one or more topics that contain Protobuf serialized messages, you can configure Redpanda Console to deserialize 
    the binary content into JSON, which makes the message human-readable. The resulting message can also be used in the 
    [programmable push filters](../../reference/console/programmable-push-filters) like a JavaScript object.

- [Topic Documentation](../console/topic-documentation)

    Embed your topic's documentation into Redpanda Console by providing access to a GitHub repository that hosts your documentation files in Markdown. 

- [HTTP Path Rewrites](../console/http-path-rewrites)

    Host Redpanda Console under an HTTP path different from the root path. 

- [Edit Topic Configuration](../console/edit-topic-configuration)

    Use Redpanda Console to edit the configuration of existing topics in a cluster.
