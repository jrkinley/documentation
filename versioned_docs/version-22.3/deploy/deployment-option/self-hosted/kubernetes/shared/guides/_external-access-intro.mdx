Redpanda brokers can advertise an externally accessible address that external clients can connect to.

When you created the cluster, you set the `external.domain` configuration to `customredpandadomain.local`, which means that your Redpanda brokers are advertising the following addresses:

- `redpanda-0.customredpandadomain.local`
- `redpanda-1.customredpandadomain.local`
- `redpanda-2.customredpandadomain.local`

To access your Redpanda brokers externally, you can map your worker nodes' IP addresses to these domains.

:::note
IP addresses can change. If the IP addresses of your worker nodes change, you must update your `/etc/hosts` file with the new mappings.
