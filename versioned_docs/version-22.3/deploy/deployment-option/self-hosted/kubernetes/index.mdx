Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool that helps you to manage Redpanda cluster deployments using declarative configuration files called _manifests_. Kubernetes provides a standardized way of achieving high availability, disaster recovery, and scalability.

- [Overview](../kubernetes/kubernetes-production-deployment)

    Redpanda offers two tools for deploying Redpanda clusters in Kubernetes:

    - Redpanda Helm chart (recommended)
    - Redpanda Operator (not recommended for new deployments)

- [Tutorial: Get Started](../kubernetes/get-started-dev)

    In this tutorial, you learn how to deploy Redpanda in Kubernetes using the Helm chart. You'll deploy a Redpanda cluster and an instance of Redpanda Console. You'll explore the Kubernetes components that the Helm chart deploys. Then, you'll use rpk both as an internal client and an external client to interact with your Redpanda cluster from the command line.

- [Kubernetes Cluster Requirements](../kubernetes/kubernetes-cluster-requirements)

    This topic is a checklist with the prerequisites and system requirements for installing production Redpanda in a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

- [Best Practices](../kubernetes/kubernetes-best-practices)

    This topic explains Redpanda's tips and recommendations for Kubernetes deployments.

- [Tune Worker Nodes](../kubernetes/kubernetes-tune-workers)

    To get the best performance from your hardware, set Redpanda to production mode on each worker node and run the auto-tuning tool. The auto-tuning tool identifies the hardware configuration on your worker node and optimizes the Linux kernel to give you the best performance.

- [Deploy Redpanda](../kubernetes/kubernetes-deploy)

    This topic describes how to use the Redpanda Helm chart to deploy a Redpanda cluster on Kubernetes.
