With data archiving, you can enable remote write to back up topics to cloud storage. In the event of a data center failure, data corruption, or cluster migration, you can recover your archived data from the cloud back to your cluster. Data archiving is a use case of [Tiered Storage](../tiered-storage).

Redpanda natively supports Tiered Storage with Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS). Migrating topics from one cloud provider to another is not supported.
