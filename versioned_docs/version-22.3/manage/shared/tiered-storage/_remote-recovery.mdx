When you create a topic, you can use remote recovery to download the topic data from cloud storage. You can also use remote recovery to restore a topic that was deleted from a cluster.

To create a new topic using remote recovery:

```bash
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true
```

To create a new topic using remote recovery and enable Tiered Storage on the new topic with the `redpanda.remote.write` and `redpanda.remote.read` flags:

```bash
rpk topic create <topic_name> -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true
```
