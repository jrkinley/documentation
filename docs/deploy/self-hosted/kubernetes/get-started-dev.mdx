To start with a local development cluster and learn how Redpanda works in Kubernetes, see [Deploy a Local Development Cluster with kind or minikube](../local-guide).

For end-to-end guides on secure deployments of Redpanda on managed Kubernetes services, see:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service](../aks-guide) (AKS)
- [Elastic Kubernetes Service](../eks-guide) (EKS)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine](../gke-guide) (GKE)

Or, if you're ready to go into production, see the [production deployment workflow](../production-workflow).

If you're an existing user of the Redpanda Operator, see the [Redpanda Operator documentation](../../../../reference/redpanda-operator). 

:::warning
Redpanda does not recommend the Redpanda Operator for new deployments. The Redpanda Operator was built for Redpanda Cloud and has unique features and workflows for that specific use case. If you're not already using the Redpanda Operator, continue with this tutorial to get started with the Redpanda Helm chart.
