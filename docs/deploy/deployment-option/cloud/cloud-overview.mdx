Redpanda Cloud employs a control plane and data plane architecture that ensures
no human has direct access to Redpanda brokers or customer data.

* Control plane
  The control plane is a separate entity that resides above and enforces rules
  in the data plane. The control plane is where a good deal of your Redpanda
  cluster management, operations, and maintenance takes place. While Redpanda
  Cloud clusters are configured and maintained in the control plane, they are
  self-contained and remain available even if your network connection to the
  control plane is lost.

* Data plane
  The data plane is where your data resides in Redpanda Cloud; it is
  self-contained and managed by an agent that receives instructions from the
  control plane. Redpanda Cloud clusters are interchangeably referred to as
  data planes. All network connections into the data plane take place through
  either a public endpoint or a Redpanda Cloud [VPC peering network connection](../vpc-peering).

* Agent
  The Redpanda Cloud agent, also known as the data plane agent, provisions,
  configures and maintains all the resources in the Redpanda Cloud cluster, from
  the network all the way up to the Redpanda cluster and Connectors infrastructure.
  Agent resources include cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and data plane software
  artifacts.

  Agents can be bootstrapped in two different ways: automatically by a machine
  or manually by a human. The human-driven agent bootstrap is designed for
  the Redpanda Cloud BYOC deployment type. After the agent is up and running,
  it connects to the control plane and starts dequeuing and running instructions
  to provision, configure, and maintain Redpanda Cloud clusters.

  The agent is in constant communication with the Redpanda Cloud control plane,
  receiving and running commands and exchanging metadata. Agents are authenticated
  and authorized through opaque and ephemeral tokens, and have dedicated command
  queues in the control plane. In BYOC, you can provision, configure, and
  maintain agents using rpk.

  Redpanda Cloud agents also manage Redpanda Cloud VPC peering networks. However,
  only one agent manages each network resource at a time.

  The following diagram identifies the resources, operations, and connections
  that exist in and between the Redpanda Cloud control plane and data plane.
