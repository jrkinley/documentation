Connectors provide a way to integrate Redpanda data with select data systems, and
provide a managed alternative to using the Kafka API. More specificially, a connector
subscribes to specified Kafka topics and collects messages, then shares
the messages to a specified location, such as an S3 bucket or a GCS bucket.

You can create a connector, managed by Redpanda, directly from the Redpanda
Console. Each connector form is consistent across all connectors.

- [Amazon S3 Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-s3-sink-connector)

    The Amazon S3 Sink connector stores Apache Kafka messages in an AWS S3 bucket.

- [Google BigQuery Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-gcp-bigquery-connector)

    The Google BigQuery Sink connector enables you to pipe any structured data
    from Redpanda to BigQuery tables for analytics and decision-making.

- [Google Cloud Storage Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-gcs-connector)

    The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Sink connector stores Redpanda messages in a
    Google Cloud Storage bucket.

- [Snowflake Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-snowflake-connector)

    The Snowflake Sink connector ingests and stores Redpanda structured data into a
    Snowflake database for analytics and decision-making.

- [MongoDB Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-mongodb-sink-connector)

    The MongoDB Sink connector enables you to store Redpanda structured data in
    MongoDB.

- [MongoDB Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-mongodb-source-connector)

    The MongoDB Source Connector imports collections from MongoDB database.

- [PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-postgresql-connector)

    The PostgreSQL (Debezium) Source connector enables you to import updates to Redpanda
    from PostgreSQL.

- [JDBC Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-jdbc-sink-connector)

    The JDBC Sink Connector enables you to transfer structured data from Redpanda into
    a relational database.

- [JDBC Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-jdbc-source-connector)

    The JDBC Source Connector enables you to transfer data from a relational database
    into Redpanda topics.

- [HTTP Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-http-source-connector)

   The HTTP Source connector enables change data capture (CDC) from
   JSON/HTTP APIs into Redpanda.

- [MySQL (Debezium) Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-mysql-source-connector)

   The MySQL (Debezium) Source connector enables you to import a stream of changes from MySQL,
   AmazonRDS, and Amazon Aurora relational databases.

- [MirrorMaker2 Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-mmaker-source-connector)

   The MirrorMaker2 Source connector enables you to import messages from another Kafka cluster.

- [MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-mmaker-checkpoint-connector)

   The MirrorMaker2 Checkpoint connector enables you to import consumer group offsets
   from other Kafka clusters.

- [MirrorMaker2 Heartbeat Source Connector](../managed-connectors/create-mmaker-heartbeat-connector)

   The MirrorMaker2 Heartbeat Source connector enables you to generate and send heartbeat messages
   to a local cluster's `heartbeat` topic.
