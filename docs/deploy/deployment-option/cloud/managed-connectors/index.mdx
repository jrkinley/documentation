Connectors provide a way to integrate Redpanda data with select data systems, and
provide a managed alternative to using the Kafka API. More specificially, a connector
subscribes to specified Kafka topics and collects messages, then shares
the messages to a specified location, such as an S3 bucket or a GCS bucket.

You can create a connector, managed by Redpanda, directly from the Redpanda
Console. Each connector form is consistent across all connectors.

- [Amazon S3 Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-s3-sink-connector)

    The Amazon S3 Sink connector stores Apache Kafka messages in an AWS S3 bucket.

- [Google BigQuery Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-gcp-bigquery-connector)

    The Google BigQuery Sink connector enables you to pipe any structured data from Redpanda to BigQuery tables for analytics and decision-making.

- [Google Cloud Storage Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-gcs-connector)

    The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Sink connector stores Redpanda messages in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.
