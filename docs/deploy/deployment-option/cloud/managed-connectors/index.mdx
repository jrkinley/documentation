- [Amazon S3 Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-s3-sink-connector)

    A connector subscribes to specified Kafka topics and collects messages. The
    connector periodically dumps the messages to a specified location, such as an
    S3 bucket or a GCS bucket. You can create a connector, managed by Redpanda,
    directly from the Redpanda Console.

- [Google BigQuery Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-bigquery-sink-connector)

    You can use the BigQuery Sink connector to export data from ApacheÂ® Kafka
    topics to Google BigQuery.

- [Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Sink Connector](../managed-connectors/create-gcs-sink-connector)

    The Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Sink Connector subscribes to specified Kafka
    topics and collects messages coming into them and periodically dumps the
    collected data to the specified bucket in GCS.
