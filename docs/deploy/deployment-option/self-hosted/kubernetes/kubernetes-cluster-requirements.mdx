This topic is a checklist with the prerequisites and system requirements for installing production Redpanda in a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

## Operating system

Minimum required version of the Linux kernel: <Versions name="linux-kernel"/>

## Kubernetes

Minimum required Kubernetes version: <Versions name="kubernetes"/>

Make sure to do the following:

1. [Install kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

1. [Configure the `kubeconfig` file for your cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/).

## Helm

Minimum required Helm version: <Versions name="helm"/>

[Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## Number of worker nodes

You must provision one worker node for each Redpanda broker that you plan to deploy in your Redpanda cluster. Each Pod replica that runs a Redpanda broker requires its own dedicated worker node for the following reasons:

- Redpanda brokers are designed to have access to all resources, such as CPU and memory, on their host machine.
- External clients access Redpanda brokers using the address of a worker node. See [External networking](#external-networking).

## Storage volumes

Redpanda brokers must store their data on disk. As a result, each Pod that runs a Redpanda broker must have its own storage volume.

To learn what Redpanda recommends, see the [storage best practices](../kubernetes-best-practices#storage).

To learn how to configure storage, see [Configure storage](../../../../../manage/kubernetes/configure-storage).

## External networking

For external access, each worker node in your cluster must have a static, externally accessible IP address to allow clients to connect to the NodePort Service and access the Redpanda broker.
Redpanda uses the following default ports:

| Node port | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 30081 | Schema registry |
| 30082 | HTTP proxy |
| 31092 | Kafka API |
| 31644 | Admin API |

Redpanda recommends using NodePorts instead of Loadbalancers. See the [external networking best practices](../kubernetes-best-practices#external-networking).

## Tuning

Before deploying Redpanda to production, each worker node that runs Redpanda must be tuned to optimize the Linux kernel for Redpanda processes.

See [Tuning Kubernetes Worker Nodes for Production](../kubernetes-tune-workers)
