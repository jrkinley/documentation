A list of Kafka (v3.4) producer configuration properties that are useful when developing with Redpanda.

## Producer Properties

### acks

The number of acknowledgements that a producer expects to get from a leader broker and its follower replicas in order for a send request to succeed.

**Valid values**:
- `acks=0`: no acknowledgements
- `acks=1`: one acknowledgement from the leader
- `acks=all` or `acks=-1`: acknowledgements from all in-sync replicas, as configured for the cluster or topic by `min.insync.replicas`

---

### batch.size

The maximum size in bytes of a batched message in a single send request.

**Related topics**:
- [Batching and Compression](../batching-compression)

---

### bootstrap.servers

A list of addresses of brokers that can provide the metadata a client needs to bootstrap itself and start producing topics.

---

### buffer.memory

The maximum amount of memory in bytes a producer has to store messages to send.

**Related topics**:
- [Batching and Compression](../batching-compression)

---

### client.dns.lookup

A kind specifying how to resolve DNS aliases.

---

### client.id

A unique application-specified ID for the producer client.

---

### compression.type

The compression type used for all messages published by the producer.

By default, a Redpanda cluster is configured to use a producer's `compression.type`; refer to the cluster property [`log_compression_type`](../../../reference/cluster-properties#log_compression_type).  

**Valid values**: `gzip`, `snappy`, `lz4`, `zstd`, `none`

---

### connections.max.idle.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds that a connection can idle before being closed.

---

### delivery.timeout.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds from when a send request returns to when a success or failure for the request is reported.

---

### enable.idempotence

A flag to enable a producer to publish a message multiple times and for the broker to receive it just once.

**Related topics**:
- [Idempotent Producers](../idempotent-producers)

---

### interceptor.classes

A list of classes that intercept messages before they are sent to brokers. Can mutate messages and can be used for monitoring.

---

### key.serializer

The serializer class for the keys of messages.

---

### linger.ms

The duration in milliseconds a producer waits to coalesce messages before sending a batched message.

**Related topics**:
- [Batching and Compression](../batching-compression)

---

### max.block.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds that a producer can block. For a send call, `max.block.ms` includes the time to request metadata (if metadata is unavailable) and to wait for buffer memory to become available (if `buffer.memory` has been exceeded).

---

### max.in.flight.requests.per.connection

The maximum number of in-flight unacknowledged requests a producer can make on a connection before blocking.

**Related topics**:
- [Message Reliability](../message-reliability)

---

### max.request.size

The maximum size in bytes of a producer request. Should be at least the size of the largest message to publish.

---

### metadata.max.age.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds to keep cached metadata, after which a new metadata request is made and the cached metadata is refreshed.

---

### metadata.max.idle.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds to keep cached metadata for an idle topic.

---

### partitioner.class

A partitioner class that assigns sent messages to partitions.

**Related topics**:
- [Producer concepts](../../produce-data#partitions-and-replicas)

---

### partitioner.ignore.keys

A flag to enable the partitioner to ignore the keys of messages when assigning messages to partitions.

---

### receive.buffer.bytes

The maximum size in bytes of the socket receive buffer.

---

### reconnect.backoff.max.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds to wait to reconnect to a broker.

---

### reconnect.backoff.ms

The default duration in milliseconds to wait to reconnect to a broker. Increases exponentially with each reconnection failure, up to `reconnect.backoff.max.ms`.

---

### request.timeout.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for a response to a request.

---

### retries

The number of times a producer retries sending a message before failing.

**Related topics**:
- [Message Reliability](../message-reliability)

---

### retry.backoff.ms

The minimum duration in milliseconds to wait between retry attempts.

**Related topics**:
- [Message Reliability](../message-reliability)

---

### security.providers

A list of security provider creator classes.

---

### send.buffer.bytes

The maximum size in bytes of the socket send buffer.

---

### socket.connection.setup.timeout.max.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds that a producer waits for a socket connection to be established.

### socket.connection.setup.timeout.ms

The default duration in milliseconds that a producer waits for a socket connection to be established. The duration increases with each consecutive failed connection attempt, up to the maximum `socket.connection.setup.timeout.max.ms`.

---

### transaction.timeout.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds that a transaction coordinator waits for a producer to give a status update before aborting the transaction.

---

### transactional.id

An ID that uniquely identifies the producer and its transactions with brokers. Registered with brokers before the producer starts its first transaction. Setting `transactional.id` implies setting `enable.idempotence` to `true`.

---

### value.serializer

The serializer class for the values of messages.
