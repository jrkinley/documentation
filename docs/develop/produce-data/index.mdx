Learn about Kafka producers, their features, and how to configure them when developing with Redpanda.

## About Kafka producers

A Kafka _producer_ is a client application that publishes _records_ (also known as events or messages) for one or more Kafka topics. A Redpanda cluster's brokers receive and store records written by producers. Producers communicate with Redpanda through the Kafka Producer API. Published records are consumed from Redpanda by Kafka consumers that subscribe to the topics.

### Producing records

To publish a record for a topic to Redpanda, a client:
- Creates a producer with configured producer properties.
- Creates a record for a topic.
- Sends the record. 

:::note
For code examples of a producer sending a record, refer to the examples in [Create producer](../code-examples#create-producer).
:::

Of the producer properties configured, the important properties include:
- The address(es) of the Redpanda broker(s) that the client can contact and get the metadata to initialize itself (bootstrap) with the cluster.
- The serializers for the keys and values of the records.

A record goes through several steps in a producer's send call:
- Processed by interceptors (if enabled by producer configuration)
- Serialized
- Assigned to a partition
- Compressed (if enabled by producer configuration)
- Added to a batch (if enabled by producer configuration)

The keys and values of records are converted to byte arrays by a producer's configured serializers. You can influence the time and space efficiency of your streaming setup by choosing one of the built-in serializers or writing a custom one. The performance consequences of using serializers is not typically significant. 

- For example, if you opt for the JSON serializer, you will have more data to transport with each record because every record will contain its schema in a verbose format, which impacts your compression speeds and network throughput. Alternatively, going with AVRO or Protobuf allows you to only define the schema in one place, while also enabling features like schema evolution.

The send request may block when being intercepted, serialized, partition-assigned, or compressed. If being batched, a send request won't send a record over the network until the batch is full, the time to wait to coalesce records has elapsed, another record to the same broker is about to be sent and it has space for this record, or the producer is being flushed.

A broker can respond to a send with a success or an error. The returned error can be resolvable or unresolvable with a retry. If resolvable with a retry, and the producer is configured to retry, the producer can resend the record.


### Partitions and replicas

A producer can publish records for one or more topics. Given that a topic can be partitioned across one or more brokers (with each partition of a topic assigned to a different broker), a producer can publish records to different partitions in parallel. Adding partitions for a topic can increase throughput.

A producer controls which partitions it publishes to. Records of a single topic are sent to different partitions, based on a partition index specified when publishing a record, or a partitioning strategy of the producer's _partitioner_. Kafka's built-in partitioner assigns a record to a partition based on the record's key:

- If a record's key is null, a partitioner assigns partitions in a round-robin fashion (Kafka 2.3 and earlier) or in a sticky fashion (Kafka 2.4 and later).
  - A round-robin partitioner optimizes for the equal distribution of records amongst partitions.
  - A sticky partitioner optimizes for larger record batches, where records of the same batch are sent to the same "sticky" partition.
- Otherwise, if a record's key is non-null, the partitioner assigns partitions based on the key's hash. Records with the same key (hash) are assigned to the the same partition. By default, the partitioner hashes keys with the murmur2 algorithm.

A partition stores records in the order they were published, and a consumer reads records from a partition also in the order they were published. Ordering of records across producers however is arbitrary.

Because a partition is usually replicated across different brokers, a producer sends records to only one broker of the partition, the _leader_. The leader receives records from the producer, and the other replicas, the _followers_, receive copies of the records from the leader. A replica that has successfully received all published records is an _in-sync replica_. A leader is always an in-sync replica, and a follower that hasn't received all published records is an out-of-sync replica. A leader knows whether a follower is in-sync or out-of-sync.


## Configure producers

Learn about producer features and how to configure them in the following topics:

- [Idempotent Producers](../produce-data/idempotent-producers)

    Learn about exactly-once record delivery and how to implement it by enabling idempotent producers.

- [Record Reliablity](../produce-data/record-reliability)

    Learn about record delivery reliability and how to customize a Kafka producer to wait for acknowledgements from Redpanda brokers and to resend unacknowledged records.

- [Batching and Compression](../produce-data/batching-compression)

    Learn about record batching and data compression and how to apply them to increase your throughput. 

- [Transactions](../transactions)

    Learn about publishing and consuming records atomically and with exactly-once semantics by using transactions. 

## Optimize producers

Configure your producer to optimize for performance (throughput, latency) or safety.

### Throughput and latency

From a producer perspective, when you want to get data into
Redpanda as quickly as possible, you can maximize throughput in a variety of ways.
You can set other componentsâ€™ parameters, like experimenting with the topic
partition size. You can also test [acks](#producer-acknowledgement-settings) settings.

For example, the quicker a producer receives a reply from the broker that the
record has been committed, the sooner it can send the next record, which
generally results in higher throughput. Hence, if you set `acks=1`, then the
leader broker would not have to wait for replication to occur, and it can reply
as soon as it is finished committing the record. As mentioned earlier, this
can result in less durability overall.

Another option to explore is how the producer batches records. Increasing the
value of `batch.size` and `linger.ms` can increase throughput by making the
producer add more records into one batch before sending it to the broker and
waiting until the batches can properly fill up. This approach negatively impacts
latency though. By contrast, if you minimize `linger.ms` (for example, to `0`)
and `batch.size` to `1`, you can achieve lower latency, but sacrifice throughput.

### Optimizing for safety

For applications where you must guarantee that there are no lost records,
duplicates, or service downtime, you can use higher durability `acks` settings.
If you set `acks=all`, then the producer will wait for a majority of replicas to
acknowledge the record before it can send the next record, resulting in lower
latency, because there is more communication required between brokers. This
approach can guarantee higher durability because the record will be replicated
to all brokers.

You can also increase durability by increasing the number of retries the broker
is allowed to make in case records are not delivered successfully. The trade-off
is that you may allow duplicates to enter the system and potentially alter the
ordering of records.
