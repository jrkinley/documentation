Learn about reliable record delivery and how to customize a Kafka producer to wait for acknowledgements from Redpanda brokers and to resend unacknowledged records.

## About record reliability

A record published by a producer may or may not be received by a broker. While one producer application may allow records to be dropped and not reach a broker, another producer application may require every record to be logged and fully replicated. 

The levels of reliable record delivery can be categorized as best-effort and reliable:

- A best-effort level of delivery doesn't guarantee successful reception by any broker. A producer writes a record and can immediately write another record, without waiting for an acknowledgement from a broker about the previous record's reception. Either a leader broker receives the sent record, or the record is lost. Use cases that send periodic updates of the latest value can use best-effort, no acknowledgement reliability. Without the overhead of acknowledgements (or record retries), this use case trades-off the risk of data loss for the benefit of higher throughput and lower latency.

- A reliable level of delivery guarantees at least one broker has successfully received a record. A producer writes a record and expects either the leader or all insync-replicas to acknowledge record reception. When a record isn't acknowledged, a producer retries sending it. Use cases that require higher levels of fault tolerance and minimal risk of data loss should configure producers to require acknowledgements from brokers.

## Configuring record reliability

Configure a producer's properties to customize reliable record delivery.

### acks

The `acks` property sets the number of brokers that a producer waits for and expects to acknowledge a sent record.

The valid values of `acks`:

- [`acks=0`](#acks0): don't wait for any acknowledgement.
- [`acks=1`](#acks1): wait for acknowledgement from the leader broker.
- [`acks=all`](#acksall): wait for acknowledgments from all in-sync replicas.

If acknowledgements are expected but not received, a producer can be configured to resend a record up to a maximum limit with the [`retries`](#retries) property, and it can be configured to have a maximum number of in-flight resent records with the [`max.in.flight.requests.per.connection`](#maxinflightrequestsperconnection) property.

#### acks=0

The producer doesn’t wait for acknowledgments from the leader and doesn’t retry
sending records. This increases throughput and lowers latency of the system at
the expense of durability and data loss.

This option allows a producer to immediately consider a record acknowledged when
it is sent to the Redpanda broker. This means that a producer does not have to wait
for any kind of response from the Redpanda broker. This is the least safe option
because a leader-node crash can cause data loss if the data has not yet
replicated to the other nodes in the replica set. However, this setting is useful
in cases where you want to optimize for the highest throughput, and are willing
to risk some data loss.

Because of the lack of guarantees, this setting is the most network bandwidth-efficient. This makes it useful for use cases like IoT/sensor data collection, where updates are periodic or stateless and you can afford some degree of data loss, but prefer gathering as much data as possible in a given time interval.

#### acks=1

The producer waits for an acknowledgment from the leader, but it doesn’t wait
for the leader to get acknowledgments from followers. This setting doesn’t
prioritize throughput, latency, or durability. Instead, `acks=1` attempts to
provide a balance between all of them.

Replication is not guaranteed with this setting because it happens in the
background, after the acknowledgement is sent to the producer from the leader
broker. This setting could result in data loss if the leader broker crashes
before any followers manage to replicate the record.

#### acks=all

The producer waits for the leader to receive acknowledgements from in-sync replicas. This increases durability at the expense of lower throughput and increased latency.

Sometimes referred to as `acks = -1`, `acks=all` configures a leader to wait for a [quorum of replicas](../../../get-started/architecture/#raft-consensus-algorithm) to successfully copy a record before acknowledging its reception. Replication involves calling `fsync`, so as soon as `fsync` is complete, the record is considered acknowledged.

:::info
With `acks=all`, a Redpanda broker guarantees that an acknowledged record has been flushed to disk with `fsync()`. This is a stronger data resiliency guarantee than a Kafka broker, which doesn't guarantee flushing to disk on acknowledgement.

### retries

The `retries` property sets the number of times a record is resent to the broker
if the broker fails to acknowledge it. This is essentially the same
as if the client application resends the erroneous record after receiving an
error response. The default value of `retries` in most client libraries is 0.
This means that if the send fails, the record is not re-sent at all.

If you increase this number to a higher value, be sure to take a look at the
`max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` value as well, as leaving that parameter
at its default value can potentially cause ordering issues in the target topic
where the records arrive. This occurs if two batches are sent to a single
partition and the first fails and is retired, but the second succeeds so the
records in the second batch may appear first.

### max.in.flight.requests.per.connection

The `max.in.flight.requests.per.connection` property sets how many unacknowledged records are allowed
to be sent to the broker simultaneously at any given time. The default value is 5. If you set this parameter to 1, then the producer will not send any more
records until the previous one is either acknowledged or an error happens, which
can prompt a retry. If you set this parameter to a value higher than 1, then the
producer will send more records at the same time, which can help to increase
throughput, but add a risk of record reordering if retries are enabled.

In cases when you configure the producer to be [idempotent](../../produce-data/idempotent-producers).
up to five requests can be guaranteed to be in flight with the order preserved.
