Learn about Kafka consumers, their features, and how to configure them when developing with Redpanda.

## About Kafka consumers

A Kafka _consumer_ is a client application that subscribes to records (also known as events or messages) from one or more Kafka topics. A consumer receives records from Redpanda brokers, with the records originally published by Kafka producers. Consumers communicate with Redpanda through the Kafka Consumer API.

### Consuming records

To consume a record for a topic from Redpanda, a client:
- Creates a consumer with configured consumer properties. 
- Subscribes to one or more topics.
- Polls for available records, usually in a polling loop.

:::note
For code examples of a consumer consuming records, refer to the examples in [Create consumer](../code-examples#create-consumer).
:::

Of the consumer properties configured, the important properties include:
- The address(es) of the Redpanda broker(s) that the client can contact and get the metadata to initialize itself (bootstrap) with the cluster.
- The deserializers for the keys and values of the records.

For a reference list of consumer properties, refer to [Consumer Configuration Properties](../consume-data/consumer-properties).

### Logs and offsets

A record is appended and stored by a Redpanda broker in a log per partition. A logged record's _offset_ is its numerical position in the log relative to the start of the log, where the first record has offset _0_ and the *Nth* record has offset *N-1*. A record's offset uniquely identifies it within a partition. 

### Partitions

Records of a single topic are stored in one to many partitions. A consumer can consume from zero or more partitions, and a partition can be consumed by at most one consumer. With partitions replicated across different brokers, a consumer receives records from either the _leader_ broker of a partition or, in Kafka 2.4 and later, any follower in clusters that support follower fetching.

## Configure consumers

Learn about consumer features and how to configure them in the following topics:

- [Consumer Polling and Fetching](poll-fetch)

  Learn about the poll method of the Kafka Consumer API, the fetch requests that it makes, and how to configure the flow of fetched records for your consumer.

- [Consumer Offsets](consumer-offsets)

  Learn about consumer offsets&mdash;the position of each consumer's last read record&mdash;and how Redpanda brokers support them.

- [Consumer Groups](consumer-groups)

  Learn about consumer groups, how they enable different consumers to consume from partitions of a topic in parallel, and how to configure them when consuming from Redpanda.

- [Transactions](../transactions)

  Learn about publishing and consuming records atomically and with exactly-once semantics by using transactions.
