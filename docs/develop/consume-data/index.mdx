Learn about Kafka consumers and how to configure them when developing with Redpanda.

## About Kafka consumers

A Kafka _consumer_ is a client application that subscribes to messages (also known as events or records) from one or more Kafka topics. A consumer receives messages from Redpanda brokers, with the messages originally published by Kafka producers. Consumers communicate with Redpanda through the Kafka Consumer API.

### Logs and offsets

A message is appended and stored by a Redpanda broker in a log. A logged message's _offset_ is its numerical position in the log relative to the start of the log, where the first message has offset _0_ and the _N_th message has offset _N-1_. A message's offset uniquely identifies it within a partition. 

### Partitions

Messages of a single topic are stored in one to many partitions. A consumer can consume from zero or more partitions, and a partition can be consumed by at most one consumer. With partitions replicated across different brokers, a consumer receives messages from either the _leader_ broker of a partition or, in Kafka 2.4 and later, any follower in clusters that support follower fetching.

## Producer configuration guides

To learn more about a consumer feature and how to configure it, follow these guides:

- [Consumer Offsets](consumer-offsets)

  Learn about consumer offsets, the position of each consumer's last read message, and how Redpanda brokers support them.

- [Consumer Groups](consumer-groups)

  Learn about Kafka consumer offsets and how Redpanda brokers support them.

- [Consumer Polling and Fetching](poll-fetch)

- [Transactions](../transactions)
