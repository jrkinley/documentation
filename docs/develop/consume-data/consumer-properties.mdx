A list of Kafka (v3.4) consumer configuration properties that are useful when developing with Redpanda.

## Consumer properties

### allow.auto.create.topics

A flag to allow a broker to automatically create a topic that doesn't exist and that a consumer is consuming.

--- 

### auto.commit.interval.ms

The period at which a consumer's offset is automatically committed. Used when automatic offset committal is enabled by [`enable.auto.commit`](#enableautocommit).

**Related topics**:
- [Consumer Offsets](../consumer-offsets)

--- 

### auto.offset.reset

Determines how to set the consumer offset for a partition when no position has been committed yet, usually when a consumer joins a new group:

- `earliest`: set the consumer offset to the earliest (smallest) offset of the partition
- `latest`: set the consumer offset to the latest (largest) offset of the partition
- `none`: don't set the consumer offset

--- 

### bootstrap.servers

A list of addresses of brokers that can provide the metadata a consumer needs to start consuming topics from the cluster.

--- 

### check.crcs

--- 

### client.dns.lookup

--- 

### client.id

The ID of the client application.

--- 

### client.rack

--- 

### connections.max.idle.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds that a connection can idle before it is closed.

--- 

### default.api.timeout.ms

The default timeout duration for all client APIs.
 
--- 

### enable.auto.commit

A flag to enable automatic committal of a consumer's offset after consuming messages. Messages are committed at the period set by [`auto.commit.interval.ms`](#autocommitintervalms).

--- 

### exclude.internal.topics

--- 

### fetch.max.bytes

The maximum number of bytes returned by a fetch request.

--- 

### fetch.max.wait.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds to wait for data for a fetch request.

--- 

### fetch.min.bytes

The minimum number of bytes returned by a fetch request.

--- 

### group.id

The ID of the consumer group a consumer belongs to.

--- 

### group.instance.id

--- 

### heartbeat.interval.ms

The period a consumer sends heartbeat messages to assert its liveliness.

--- 

### interceptor.classes

--- 

### isolation.level

--- 

### key.deserializer

The class used to deserialize the key of a consumed message.

--- 

### max.partition.fetch.bytes

The maximum number of bytes returned from one partition in a fetch request. 

--- 

### max.poll.interval.ms

The maximum duration a consumer can go without polling for new messages before it is considered unresponsive and removed from a consumer group. 

--- 

### max.poll.records

The maximum number of records (messages) returned in a poll request.

--- 

### metadata.max.age.ms

The maximum duration in milliseconds to cache topic metadata. When elapsed, a new metadata request is made to a broker, and the cache is refreshed with the new metadata.

--- 

### metric.reporters

--- 

### metrics.num.samples

--- 

### metrics.log.level

--- 

### metrics.sample.window.ms

--- 

### partition.assignment.strategy

--- 

### receive.buffer.bytes

--- 

### reconnect.backoff.max.ms

--- 

### reconnect.backoff.ms

--- 

### request.timeout.ms

The maximum duration that a consumer client will wait for a response from a broker.

--- 

### retry.backoff.ms

--- 

### security.providers

--- 

### send.buffer.bytes

--- 

### session.timeout.ms

--- 

### socket.connection.setup.timeout.max.ms

--- 

### socket.connection.setup.timeout.ms

--- 

### value.deserializer

The class used to deserialize the value of a consumed message.
