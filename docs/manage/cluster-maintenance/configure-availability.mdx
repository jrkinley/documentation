## Limit Client Connections

A malicious or compromised Kafka client may create many network connections to execute its attacks. To mitigate the risk of a bad client creating too many connections and taking down a node, you can configure a Redpanda cluster to impose limits on the number of created client connections for its Kafka protocol server nodes. 

The following cluster properties limit the number of connections:

- [kafka_connections_max](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_connections_max): Similar to Kafka's `max.connections`, this property sets the maximum number of connections created by a node.
- [kafka_connections_max_per_ip](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_connections_max_per_ip): Similar to Kafka's `max.connections.per.ip`, this property sets the maximum number of connections created per IP address by a node.

Redpanda also provides properties to manage the rate of connection creation:

- [kafka_connection_rate_limit](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_connection_rate_limit): This property limits the maximum rate of connections created per second. It applies per CPU core.
- [kafka_connection_rate_limit_overrides](../../../reference/cluster-properties#kafka_connection_rate_limit_overrides): For targeted overrides of `kafka_connection_rate_limit`, this property enables unlimited connection creation to the IP addresses specified in the property's list.

:::note notes
- These connection limit properties are disabled by default. You must manually enable them.
- Typically, a client opens two or three connections, so the total number of connections is not equal to the number of clients.
