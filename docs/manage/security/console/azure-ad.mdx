Integrating Redpanda Console with Azure AD allows your users to use their Azure AD identities to sign in to Redpanda Console.
This guide assumes you already have an Azure AD account and permissions to create Applications within your directory.

## Create an OpenID connect application

Begin by registering your app in the Azure Portal. Provide the following information:

* Display name
* Supported account types that can access the API (choose single tenant, multi-tenant, or personal accounts)
* Redirect URI (select `Web` as the platform)

After the app is registered, the overview page opens. This page contains the client ID and client secret, which you paste into the `redpanda-console-config.yaml file`.

For more information, see the Microsoft documentation for [configuring an OpenID connect provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/configure-openid-settings).

:::note
The configurations below assume that you want to host Redpanda Console so it is accessible at
`https://console.yourcompany.com`.
:::

- **Name:** Any descriptive name for your specific Console deployment (for example Console Analytics Prod)
- **Supported account types** Select an option that matches your needs. If you are unsure, click "Help me choose...".
- **Redirect URIs** Web / `https://console.yourcompany.com/login/callbacks/azure-ad`

```yaml
login:
  enabled: true

  # jwtSecret is the secret key you must use to sign and encrypt the JSON
  # web token used to store user sessions. This secret key is
  # critical for the security of Redpanda Console's authentication and
  # authorization system. Use a long, complex key with a combination of
  # numbers, letters, and special characters. The minimum number of
  # characters is 10, but Redpanda recommends using more than 32
  # characters. For additional security, use a different secret key for
  # each environment. To securely generate a jwtSecret key, run the following
  # command: LC_ALL=C tr -dc '[:alnum:]' < /dev/random | head -c32
  #
  # If you update this secret key, any users who are
  # already logged in to Redpanda Console will be logged out and will have
  # to log in again.
  jwtSecret: ""

  azureAd:
    enabled: true
    # ProviderURL must be specified in the following format:
    # https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/v2.0 .
    # To get this URL, browse to the registered app in your 
    # Azure Portal and click the "Endpoints" tab. A drawer 
    # opens with several links. The link below 
    # "OpenID Connect metadata document" contains the 
    # provider URL; however, you must trim the suffix 
    # "/.well-known/openid-configuration" so that it 
    # matches the expected format.
    providerUrl: ""

    clientId: ""
    clientSecret: ""

    #  userIdentifyingClaimKey is a relevant property if you want 
    #  to use a different claim key to identify users in the 
    #  role binding. By default, we will use the 'oid' claim key,
    #  which resolves to the unique user ID within the identity 
    #  provider. This means that you must provide the oid 
    #  identifier in the roleBindings as 'name' as well. 
    #  Other common options are:
    #  - upn (unique principal name - you need to add the upn 
    #    claim as a claim for id tokens in your Azure AD application)
    #  - email (under certain conditions there's no value for 
    #    the email propagated)
    userIdentifyingClaimKey: "oid"

    # The directory config is only required if you want to use 
    # Azure AD groups in your role bindings. Described further
    # in the next section.
    # directory:
    #   tenantId: ""
```

## RBAC Azure AD groups sync

If you want to bind roles to Azure groups from your organization you have to provide the `tenantId` in the
directory configuration and add API permissions to your client application. To retrieve the `tenantId` go to
your registered application in the Azure Active Directory portal. The "Directory (tenant) ID" is listed
along other configurations in the essentials section.

```yaml
login:
  azureAd:
    directory:
      tenantId: ""
```

If you specify the `tenantId` Console will talk to the Microsoft Graph API to retrieve the memberships
for the specified groups. Therefore the client needs the apropriate permissions. In your AzureAD application
head to "API permissions" and add permissions for "Group.Read.All", "User.Read.All" and "Directory.Read.All".
Then also grant admin consent for the default directory by clicking the "Grant admin constent for Default Directory"
button.

## Define role-bindings

When you set up the GitHub login configuration, you can bind GitHub users or groups to roles. Following is a sample
role binding:

```yaml
roleBindings:
  - metadata:
      name: Developers
    subjects:
      - kind: group
        provider: AzureAD
        # Name for group always refers to the group's oid.
        name: ef0dd5b8-93c3-4a4f-9d90-cba243973d32
      - kind: user
        provider: AzureAD
        # Name refers to the user's OID.
        # This is dependent on your userIdentifyingClaimKey
        # configuration. If you use `email` as claim key
        # you should use the email address instead here.
        name: c86fdb3f-b0f4-4b0b-9be3-ddf56f48b62f
    roleName: editor
```

:::note
The resolved group memberships will also include transitive members. Thus, you can
create nested groups and refer these in your role bindings.
