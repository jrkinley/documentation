Data archiving is one use case for Tiered Storage. With data archiving, you can enable remote write so you can back up topics to cloud storage. In the event of a data center failure, data corruption, or cluster migration, you can recover your archived data from the cloud back to your cluster. 

In order to read data from cloud storage, you need to enable remote read. When remote read is disabled, data can only be read from local storage. 

:::note
Redpanda supports data archiving to Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage.

## Configure data archiving

Data archiving requires a Tiered Storage configuration. See [Tiered Storage](../tiered-storage) for detailed information about these steps:

1. Enable remote write at the [cluster level](../tiered-storage/#enable-tiered-storage-for-a-cluster) or [topic level](../tiered-storage/#enable-tiered-storage-for-a-topic). Optionally, enable remote read. 

2. [Set retention limits](../tiered-storage/#set-retention-limits). 
   
To recover a topic from cloud storage, use [remote recovery](../tiered-storage/#remote-recovery).

## Stop data archiving
   
To cancel archiving jobs, disable remote write. 

To delete archival data, adjust `retention.ms` or `retention.bytes`.
