Topic-level properties configure a Kafka or Redpanda property per topic. Each topic-level property overrides the value of a corresponding node (broker) or cluster property. If no topic-level property is set, the corresponding node or cluster property takes effect by default.

## Example commands

### Create topic with topic properties

To set topic properties when creating a topic, use the [rpk topic create -c](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-create) command and option.

For example, to create a topic with the `cleanup.policy` property set to `compact`:

```
rpk topic create -c cleanup.policy=compact <topic>
```

### Modify topic properties

To set or modify topic properties of a created topic, use the [rpk topic alter-config](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-alter-config) command.

For example, to modify a topic's `retention.ms` property:

```bash
rpk topic alter-config <topic> --set retention.ms=<retention_time>
```

## Properties

### compression.type

`compression.type` configures the type of compression algorithm to apply for all messages of a topic. When a compression type is set for a topic, producers compress and send messages, nodes (brokers) store and send compressed messages, and consumers receive and uncompress messages.

While messages aren't compressed by default (`compression.type = none`), enabling compression to reduce message size improves throughput and decreases storage for messages with repetitive values and data structures, with the trade-off of added CPU utilization and network latency to perform the compression. Enabling producer batching usually increases compression efficiency, as the messages of a batch likely have repeated data within them to compress.

When `compression.type` is set, it overrides the cluster property [`log_compression_type`](../cluster-properties#log_compression_type) for the topic.

**Default**: `none`

**Values**:

- `none`
- `gzip`
- `lz4`
- `snappy`
- `ztsd`

**Related topics**:

- [Common producer configuration options](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#commonly-used-producer-configuration-options)

---

### cleanup.policy

`cleanup.policy` is a list that configures the cleanup policies for log segments of a topic. The available cleanup policies:

- **delete**. Deletes segments whose retention limits have been exceeded.
- **compact**. Enables log compaction to keep the last value per key.

You can set one or both policies. If both are set (`[compact,delete]`), the last values per key are kept while the remaining data is deleted according to retention limits.

When `cleanup.policy` is set, it overrides the cluster property [log_cleanup_policy](../cluster-properties#log_cleanup_policy) for the topic.

**Default**: `[delete]`

**Values**:

- `[delete]`
- `[compact]`
- `[compact,delete]`

**Related topics**:
- [Segment size for compacted segments](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#segment-size-for-compacted-segments)

---

### compaction.strategy

**Values**:

- `offset`
- `timestamp`
- `header`

---

### message.timestamp.type

`message.timestamp.type` configures the source of a message's timestamp to be either the message's creation time or its log append time.

When `message.timestamp.type` is set, it overrides the cluster property [log_message_timestamp_type](../cluster-properties#log_message_timestamp_type) for the topic.

**Default**: `'CreateTime'` 

**Values**:
- `'CreateTime'`
- `'LogAppendTime'`

---

### segment.bytes

`segment.bytes` configures the maximum size of a log segment for a topic.

When `segment.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`log_segment_size`](../tunable-properties#log_segment_size) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Configure segment size](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-segment-size)
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)
- [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas)

---

### retention.bytes

`retention.bytes` configures the maximum size that a topic partition can grow when the cleanup policy is `delete`. The total retention in bytes for a topic is this value multiplied by the number of partitions for the topic.

If `retention.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`retention_bytes`](../cluster-properties#retention_bytes) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)

---

### retention.ms

`retention.ms` configures the maximum duration to keep a log before deleting old segments when the cleanup policy is `delete`. If a non-positive value, no limit is applied.

If `retention.ms` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`delete_retention_ms`](../cluster-properties#delete_retention_ms) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)

---

### max.message.bytes

`max.message.bytes` configures the maximum size of a message or batched message of a topic. Applies after compression, if compression is enabled.

If `max.message.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`kafka_batch_max_bytes`](../tunable-properties#kafka_batch_max_bytes) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Message batching](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#message-batching)

---

### redpanda.remote.recovery

When the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature is enabled, `redpanda.remote.recovery` is the flag that enables the recovery or reproduction of a topic from cloud storage. The recovered data is saved in local storage, and the amount of recovered data is in accordance with the local storage retention limits of the topic.

---

### redpanda.remote.write

`redpanda.remote.write` is a flag for enabling Redpanda to upload data for a topic from local storage to cloud storage. When set together with [redpanda.remote.read](#redpandaremoteread), it enables the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature.

---

### redpanda.remote.read

`redpanda.remote.read` is a flag for enabling Redpanda to fetch data for a topic from cloud storage to local storage. When set together with [redpanda.remote.write](#redpandaremotewrite), it enables the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature.

---

### redpanda.remote.readreplica

For the [Remote Read Replica](../../manage/remote-read-replicas) feature, `redpanda.remote.readreplica` configures the name of the cloud storage bucket for a Remote Read Replica topic.

---

### retention.local.target.bytes

When the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature is enabled, `retention.local.target.bytes` configures that maximum size that a topic partition in local storage can grow when the cleanup policy is `delete`.

---

### retention.local.target.ms

When the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature is enabled, `retention.local.target.ms` configures the maximum duration to keep a log in local storage before deleting old segments when the cleanup policy is `delete`.

---

### replication.factor

`replication.factor` configures the number of copies of a topic saved in different nodes (brokers).

---

### redpanda.remote.delete

When the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature is enabled, `redpanda.remote.delete` is a flag that enables the deletion of data for a topic from remote storage when it's deleted from local storage.

:::note
`redpanda.remote.delete` doesn't apply to Remote Read Replica topics: a Remote Read Replica topic isn't deleted from cloud storage when this flag is `true`.
:::

---

### segment.ms

`segment.ms` configures the default log rolling timeout for a topic. Periodically, an active log segment is closed and a new segment is created to store newly written data.

If set to a positive duration, `segment.ms` overrides the cluster property [log_segment_ms](../cluster-properties#log_segment_ms).

**Default**: null

**Related topics**: 
[Log rolling](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#log-rolling)
