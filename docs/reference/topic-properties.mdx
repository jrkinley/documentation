A topic-level property sets a Redpanda or Kafka configuration for a particular topic. 

Each topic-level property overrides the value of a corresponding node (broker) or cluster property. If a topic-level property isn't set, the corresponding node or cluster property takes effect by default.

## Examples

To configure topic-level properties, follow these examples.

### Create topic with topic properties

To set topic properties when creating a topic, use the [rpk topic create](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-create) command with the `-c` option.

For example, to create a topic with the `cleanup.policy` property set to `compact`:

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
<TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

```bash
rpk topic create -c cleanup.policy=compact <topic-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rpk topic create -c cleanup.policy=compact<topic-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To configure multiple properties for a topic, use the `-c` option for each property.

For example, to create a topic with all necessary properties for Tiered Storage:

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
<TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

```bash
rpk topic create -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true <topic-name> 
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rpk topic create -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true <topic-name> 
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Modify topic properties

To set or modify topic properties of an existing topic, use the [rpk topic alter-config](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-alter-config) command.

For example, to modify a topic's `retention.ms` property:

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
<TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

```bash
rpk topic alter-config <topic-name> --set retention.ms=<retention-time>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rpk topic alter-config <topic-name> --set retention.ms=<retention-time>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Properties

This section describes all supported topic-level properties.

### Disk space properties

Configure properties to manage the disk space used by a topic:
- Clean up log segments by deletion and/or compaction ([`cleanup.policy`](#cleanuppolicy)).
- Retain logs up to a maximum size per partition before cleanup ([`retention.bytes`](#retentionbytes)).
- Retain logs for a maximum duration before cleanup ([`retention.ms`](#retentionms)).
- Periodically roll logs to inactivate segments ([`segment.ms`](#segmentms)).
- Retain log segments up to a maximum size ([`segment.bytes`](#segmentbytes)).

---

#### cleanup.policy

`cleanup.policy` is a list that configures the cleanup policies for log segments of a topic. The available cleanup policies:

- **delete**. Deletes data according to size-based and/or time-based retention limits.
- **compact**. Deletes data according to a key-based retention policy, discarding all but the latest value per key.

You can set one or both policies. If both are set (`[compact,delete]`), the last values per key are kept while the remaining data is deleted according to retention limits.

When `cleanup.policy` is set, it overrides the cluster property [log_cleanup_policy](../cluster-properties#log_cleanup_policy) for the topic.

**Default**: `[delete]`

**Values**:

- `[delete]`
- `[compact]`
- `[compact,delete]`

**Related topics**:
- [Segment size for compacted segments](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#segment-size-for-compacted-segments)

---

#### retention.bytes

`retention.bytes` is a size-based retention limit that configures the maximum size that a topic partition can grow before becoming eligible for cleanup. After a topic partition reaches `retention.bytes` in size, it

If `retention.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`retention_bytes`](../cluster-properties#retention_bytes) for the topic, and the total retained size for the topic is `retention.bytes` multiplied by the number of partitions for the topic.

When both size-based and time-based retention limits are set (for example, `retention.bytes` and `retention.ms`, respectively), cleanup occurs when either limit is reached.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)

---

#### retention.ms

`retention.ms` is a time-based retention limit that configures the maximum duration that a log's segment file for a topic is retained before it becomes eligible to be cleaned up. To consume all data, a consumer of the topic must read from a segment before its `retention.ms` elapses, otherwise the segment may be compacted and/or deleted. If a non-positive value, no per-topic limit is applied.

If `retention.ms` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`delete_retention_ms`](../cluster-properties#delete_retention_ms) for the topic. 

When both size-based and time-based retention limits are set (for example, `retention.bytes` and `retention.ms`, respectively), the earliest occurring limit applies.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)

---

#### segment.ms

`segment.ms` configures the duration that a log segment is active&mdash;being written to by producers and not deletable&mdash;for a topic. It's the periodic timeout at which a log closes the active segment of a topic and transitions, or rolls, to a new active segment. The closed, inactive segment is then eligible to be cleaned up according to retention properties.

If set to a positive duration, `segment.ms` overrides the cluster property [log_segment_ms](../cluster-properties#log_segment_ms).

**Default**: null

**Related topics**: 
[Log rolling](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#log-rolling)

---

#### segment.bytes

`segment.bytes` configures the maximum size of a log segment for a topic. When the size of an active segment exceeds `segment.bytes`, the segment is closed and a new active segment is created. The closed, inactive segment is then eligible to be cleaned up according to retention properties.

When `segment.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`log_segment_size`](../tunable-properties#log_segment_size) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Configure segment size](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-segment-size)
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)
- [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas)

---

### Message properties

Configure properties for the messages of a topic:
- Compress a message or batch to reduce storage space and increase throughput ([`compression.type`](#compressiontype)).
- Set the source of a message's timestamp ([message.timestamp.type](#messagetimestamptype)).
- Set the maximum size of a message ([max.message.bytes](#maxmessagebytes)).

#### compression.type

`compression.type` configures the type of compression algorithm to apply for all messages of a topic. When a compression type is set for a topic, producers compress and send messages, nodes (brokers) store and send compressed messages, and consumers receive and uncompress messages.

While messages aren't compressed by default (`compression.type = none`), enabling compression to reduce message size improves throughput and decreases storage for messages with repetitive values and data structures, with the trade-off of added CPU utilization and network latency to perform the compression. Enabling producer batching usually increases compression efficiency, as the messages of a batch likely have repeated data within them to compress.

When `compression.type` is set, it overrides the cluster property [`log_compression_type`](../cluster-properties#log_compression_type) for the topic.

**Default**: `none`

**Values**:

- `none`
- `gzip`
- `lz4`
- `snappy`
- `ztsd`

**Related topics**:
- [Message batching](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#message-batching)
- [Common producer configuration options](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#commonly-used-producer-configuration-options)

---

#### message.timestamp.type

`message.timestamp.type` configures the source of a message's timestamp to be either the message's creation time or its log append time.

When `message.timestamp.type` is set, it overrides the cluster property [log_message_timestamp_type](../cluster-properties#log_message_timestamp_type) for the topic.

**Default**: `'CreateTime'` 

**Values**:
- `'CreateTime'`
- `'LogAppendTime'`

---

#### max.message.bytes

`max.message.bytes` configures the maximum size of a message or batch of a topic. If a compression type is enabled, it sets the maximum size of the compressed message or batch.

If `max.message.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`kafka_batch_max_bytes`](../tunable-properties#kafka_batch_max_bytes) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Message batching](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#message-batching)

---

### Tiered Storage properties

Configure properties to manage topics for [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage):
- Upload and fetch data to and from object storage for a topic ([`redpanda.remote.write`](#redpandaremotewrite) and [`redpanda.remote.read`](#redpandaremoteread)). 
- Configure size-based and time-based retention properties for local storage of a topic ([`retention.local.target.bytes`](#retentionlocaltargetbytes) and [`retention.local.target.ms`](#retentionlocaltargetms)).
- Recover or reproduce data for a topic from object storage ([`redpanda.remote.recovery`](#redpandaremoterecovery)).
- Delete data from object storage for a topic when it's deleted from local storage ([`redpanda.remote.delete`](#redpandaremotedelete)).

#### redpanda.remote.write

`redpanda.remote.write` is the flag for enabling Redpanda to upload data for a topic from local storage to object storage. When set `true` together with [redpanda.remote.read](#redpandaremoteread), it enables the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature.

**Default**: false

**Related topics**:
- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### redpanda.remote.read

`redpanda.remote.read` is the flag for enabling Redpanda to fetch data for a topic from object storage to local storage. When set `true` together with [redpanda.remote.write](#redpandaremotewrite), it enables the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature.

**Default**: false

**Related topics**:
- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### retention.local.target.bytes

`retention.local.target.bytes` configures that maximum size that a topic partition in local storage can grow.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### retention.local.target.ms

`retention.local.target.ms` configures the maximum duration to keep a log in local storage before deleting old segments.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### redpanda.remote.recovery

`redpanda.remote.recovery` is the flag that enables the recovery or reproduction of a topic from object storage. The recovered data is saved in local storage, and the maximum amount of recovered data is determined by the local storage retention limits of the topic.

:::tip
`redpanda.remote.recovery` must be configured at topic creation. It cannot be configured, and does not apply, for existing topics.
:::

**Default**: false

**Related topics**:
- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### redpanda.remote.delete

When the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature is enabled, `redpanda.remote.delete` is the flag that enables deletion of data from object storage when it's deleted from local storage for a topic.

:::note
`redpanda.remote.delete` doesn't apply to Remote Read Replica topics: a Remote Read Replica topic isn't deleted from object storage when this flag is `true`.
:::

**Default**: 
- `false` for topics created prior to Redpanda 22.3.
- `true` for topics created in Redpanda 22.3 and later, including new topics on upgraded clusters. 

**Related topics**:
- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

### Remote Read Replica properties

Configure properties to manage topics for [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas).

#### redpanda.remote.readreplica

`redpanda.remote.readreplica` configures the name of the object storage bucket for a Remote Read Replica topic.

:::caution
Setting `redpanda.remote.readreplica` together with either `redpanda.remote.read` or `redpanda.remote.write` results in an error.
:::

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas)

---

### Replication properties

Configure properties to manage replication of a topic.

#### replication.factor

`replication.factor` configures the number of copies of a topic saved in different nodes (brokers) of a cluster.

If `replication.factor` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [default_topic_replications](../cluster-properties#default_topic_replications) for the topic.

**Default**: null
